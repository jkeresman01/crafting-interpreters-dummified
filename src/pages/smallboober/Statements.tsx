      <h1>Statements</h1>

      <p>Steve Jobs said that people who are crazy enough to think that they can change
      the world are the ones who do, that was a statement and a statement's job is to
      change the world in some sense, usually by modifying some state, reading input
      or producing output.</p>

      <Callout type="note">
          <p><strong>Interesting statement from: </strong>
            The philospher Friedrich Nietzcshe which is that there are no facts, only
            interpretations. This statement actually underlines the subjective nature
            of truth. In many situations the truth is simply someone's opininon. When
            someone claims to be be expressing an absoulte truth, they might in fact
            just be affirming their own subjective view of particular situation.
          </p>
       </Callout>

      <p>Okay, okay it will all make sense after some examples as I've said statements
      cause effects, they don't evaluate to a value, you've already seen at least one
      through this book, the <strong>print</strong> statement: </p>

      <CodeBlock
        language="plaintext"
        code={`print "She was smoking hot" + ", " + " mind blown!;"`}
      />

      <p>A <strong>print</strong> statement evaluates a single expression and displays
      the result to the user.</p>

      <h2>Variables</h2>

      <p>As I've said our programming language will be small and cute, it will also
      be dynamically typed, explained in simple terms, our variables can store values
      of any type and a single variable can even store values of different types at
      different times.</p>

      <p>We will follow what "Lox" does and our variables will be declared using
      <strong> var</strong> statements. Some commonly used alternatives to using var
      would be let (JavaScript, TypeScript), local (Lua) or to simply use no declaration
      keyword (Python, Ruby).</p>

      <CodeBlock
        language="plaintext"
        code={`var variable = "She was smoking hot";`}
      />

      <p>If you omit the initializer the variable's value defaults to
      <strong> nil</strong>.</p>

      <CodeBlock
        language="plaintext"
        code={`var nilValue`}
      />

      <p>Once declared you can naturally access and assign a variable using its name.</p>


      <CodeBlock
        language="plaintext"
        code={`var variable = "She was smoking hot";`}
      />

      <CodeBlock
        language="plaintext"
        code={`print variable`}
      />

    </>
  );
}
