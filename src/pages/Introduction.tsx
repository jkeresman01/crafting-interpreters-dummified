        What are we cooking in here, you probably might wonder, is it beautiful soups,
        is it a react website that my grandma could write, is it a .NET application
        written in an overbloated IDE/editor called Visual Studio for which you need a
        2 years course in order to learn what all the buttons do while some work only
        during full blood moon. Like yes, yes you really need 14567 different options
        for creating a controller and deleting WeatherForecasts is such a fun activity.
       </p>

       <p>
        The answer is of course not, we do some actual programming in here. We will vibe,
        we will code and we will write, five times we will implement an interpreter
        and five different languages we will use. No sciency boring stuff, just pure
        fun. Before all that we need to introduce some jargon, so we will talk about
        love towards programming, about "Statements" of intent and "Expression's"
        of feelings, alongside some other stuff.
       </p>

       <p>
        Five languages or not, which ones to use, that's currently on my mind, perhaps
        reading will get my inspiration back — but again does it really matter? Given
        an implementation in one, AI can handle the rest. But with all of that, the
        joy of programming has disappeared. <strong>Don't you agree?</strong>  We've
        lost that sense of building something slowly, step by step. You know to write
        a small piece of software and you can't really tell if it works — you have
        to test how it behaves, step by step, day by day.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I'll do it in the ways of old and share some thoughts along the way. Maybe
        even spin up a debugger — you know, those confusing tools meant for old
        people and ohhhhh boy are they confusing, but the thing about debugging
        sessions is to just embrace the meaningless of it all, you don't fight it,
        you just embrace it and click step over, step into buttons all day long,
        until you realize that you forgot something stupid like seven hours ago.

      <Callout type="note">
          <p><strong>Interesting side thought: </strong>
            Philosophy is important Bjarne Stroustrup also thinks that, of course he
            talks about language design, debuggers are tools of old, I will acknowledge
            that, young's are faster to learn and adapt, young in age, or young in
            spirit, still minds are quite bright, "Young people walk ahead of the adults"
            all concepts that came from the book, perhaps "you doubt" could be the
            moment of subjective reality trap, perhaps I needed to test this concept
            out, the subjective reality one,  genuine look, on first walk by proved
            just that, nonetheless it did brought an <strong> interest</strong>ing
            thought <strong>of mine</strong>. Keep looking at debugger or not? AI is
            here to stay and putting few breakpoints in could generally be just huge
            waste of time, vibes are important, and that's that. Anyhowzzy, on the
            second thought, one debugging session afterwards, perhaps second walk by
            through the codebase, failed to prove that, debugging in the ways of old
            is quite fun. You see, it's all subjective reality trap, perhaps for some,
            stepping through debugger is the only way, but we should try to see things
            objectively, perhaps one different look, or viewpoint can change your mind,
            AI is also quite fun.

        Okay, okay, enough chit chat and stuff let's see what this interpreter thing
        is all about and be aware if your background is too sciency, you will lose
        few brain cells along the way I promise you that.
